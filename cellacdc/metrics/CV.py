    """Function used to calculate coefficient of variation.

    NOTE: Make sure to call the function with the same name as the Python file
    containing this function (e.g., this file is called CV.py and the function
    is called CV)

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : numpy 1D array
        This is a numpy array with all the intensities of the signal
        from each single segmented object.
    autoBkgr : numpy 1D array
        Median of all the background pixels (i.e. pixels with value 0 in the
        segmentation mask). Pass None if background correction with
        this value is not needed.
    dataPrepBkgr : numpy 1D array
        Median of all the pixels inside the background ROIs added during the
        data prep step (Cell-ACDC module 1).
        Pass None if background correction with this vaue is not needed.
    correct_with_bkgr : boolean
        Pass True if you need background correction.
    which_bkgr : string
        which_bkgr='auto' for correction with autoBkgr or
        which_bkgr='dataPrep' for correction with dataPrepBkgr

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Coefficient of Variation
